# TrueFace AI

Welcome to **TrueFace AI**, your advanced solution for face liveness and deepfake detection. This static website provides an overview of our cutting-edge technology designed to ensure authenticity and security in digital interactions.

## Overview

**TrueFace AI** leverages state-of-the-art AI technology to offer real-time face liveness and deepfake detection. Our platform helps you verify the authenticity of faces in images and videos, providing robust protection against digital deception.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Liveness Detection:** Ensure that the face presented is live and genuine.
- **Deepfake Detection:** Identify manipulated or synthetic content with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-navigate design for seamless user experience.
- **Instant Feedback:** Get immediate results and insights into the authenticity of your media.

## Hackathon Experience

I recently had the incredible opportunity to participate in the **Smart India Hackathon 2024**, held on September 17th and 18th, where our team of six members built **TrueFace AI**. This AI-based project is designed to detect fake images and videos with high confidence. The hackathon was an amazing journey of learning, teamwork, and innovation.

### My Contributions:
- **Web Development:** Developed the initial static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Later, we transitioned to **ReactJS** for better backend integration and real-time API fetching for graphs and data visualization.
- **AI/ML Development:** Worked on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using **PyTorch** and a **ResNet** model to analyze image and video authenticity. We trained our system on more than 145,000 real and deepfake images and even added a heatmap generator to visualize the model’s output after extracting frames from videos.
